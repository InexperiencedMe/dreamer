- better critic and rewardPredictor initialization as in the paper
- add batch + sequence length, episode updates might suck


- other stuff to increase performance
    - Maybe bigger models?
    - How about first training the world model many times, then actor many times and so on, in an interleaved way, like Schmidhuber and Ha.
        - Consider this: gather 10 episodes, update world model 10 times, update actor critic 10 times
- make actor train and multiple rollouts, parralelize it
