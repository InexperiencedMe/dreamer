- Try simple dreamer behavior learning

- Implement dones and continuation prediction
    - Then train on 64 sequence lengths only, but taken randomly from the buffer
- Twohot rewards with exponentially spaced bins
- Twohot critic with exponentially spaced bins
- Logprob training, not mse loss


Also quality of life features like:
- Add function processing gym obs, dont write the line explicitly
- Better readme
