- add batch + sequence length, episode updates might suck
    - actor critic update should get full state representation as an input, not raw obs to be encoded
    - world model should update in batches
    - actor critic should update in batches and get multiple full state representations
- soft update critic
- why do value estimates constantly grow? Is everything okay with the update?


- other stuff to increase performance
    - Maybe bigger models?
    - How about first training the world model many times, then actor many times and so on, in an interleaved way, like Schmidhuber and Ha.
        - Consider this: gather 10 episodes, update world model 10 times, update actor critic 10 times
- make actor train and multiple rollouts, parralelize it
